Awesome Blossom is a website I am designing for my wife's crafting store. It will be an online site by the time I complete the AOLCC training course.
The Western Tradesman is an ongoing work in progress in which I have several versions on the go. I hope to have this site built and online for myself to run.
Cat World is a one page website with a basic layout to practice coding and  will not become a real online site.
